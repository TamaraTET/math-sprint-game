# math-sprint-game

This project  is a math based game. The game highlights the usage of timing events as well as proceduring generating  random correct and incorrect  math equations.

In this game, users are able to navigate different views within the game container. The first view is a Splash screen  that contains some radio buttons  that allow users to select the type of round they want to try in the game. If users highlight one of the radio buttons and click the "start round" button, it starts to count down, and then, to the game page.

On the game page is a series of 10 multiplication equations. The users evaluate  which equation is correct. And as they do that, it scrolls down automatically to the next equation. When the end of the equation is reached, it transfers to the Score Page, and it displays the time a user spent playing the game.

The game also a "play again" button which has a click function that allows users to start the game all over at the end of a round.
